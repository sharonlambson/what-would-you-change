**What would you change?**
We have purposefully used some bad coding practices in this test automation repo.  We would like you to review the code and make a list of the things that you would change.  The problems could be:
- bugs
- not following the pattern set out by the majority of the code in the repo
- just plain ugly coding practices
- code that is less than ideal because of maintainenance or reliabililty concerns
